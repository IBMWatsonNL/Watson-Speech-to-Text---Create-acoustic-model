    "The IBMÂ® Speech to Text service provides APIs that use IBM's speech-recognition capabilities to produce transcripts of spoken audio. The service can transcribe speech from various languages and audio formats. In addition to basic transcription, the service can produce detailed information about many different aspects of the audio. For most languages, the service supports two sampling rates, broadband and narrowband. It returns all JSON response content in the UTF-8 character set.  \n",
